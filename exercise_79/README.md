# Tic Tac Toe
 
## Summary  
*Tic Tac Toe* is a pencil and paper game for two players. This is an open-ended exercise, intentionally designed so you can design the program your way.

## Steps  

### Part 1A: Understand the Problem and Design the Structure
The instructions for this exercise is kept intentionally vague to allow for creative freedom. This means your Tic Tac Toe should probably not look like your classmate's, or even have similar classes. For this exercise, we are also starting from zero.  Think about this problem critically before we should begin to write code and describe in plain English how to design the program.  


Consider these questions to implement the tic tac toe game:
        
- What are essential classes?
- What attributes will each class have?
- What interface will each class provide?
- How will the classes interact with each other?

### Part 1B: Build The Game

Here are a list of the main instructions:
- The Board class with several methods have been provided to you. Use it as a hint to get started on the structure. You will need more methods and classes than the ones provided.
- Make a Game class should have a play method that loops, reading in user moves. When the game is over, exit the loop. You can instantiate the Game to start the game.
- You should have a class that represents a human player (HumanPlayer), and another class for a computer player (ComputerPlayer)
- Both HumanPlayer and ComputerPlayer should have the same set of methods. This means they should be interchangeable
- Your Game class should be passed two player objects on instantiation. This means you can pass in 2 human players, 2 computer players, or 1 human and 1 computer player.
- Keep the computer AI simple: make a winning move if available. Otherwise move randomly in one of the boxes still available
